Core classes, functions, and methods:
- Movie: A class representing a movie, with attributes such as title, year, and file path.
- Colorizer: A class representing the colorization algorithm, with methods for training and colorizing movies.
- Database: A class representing the database, with methods for storing and retrieving movies.
- Frontend: A class representing the front-end webpage, with methods for displaying movies and interacting with the user.

Entrypoint file: main.py
```python
from movie import Movie
from colorizer import Colorizer
from database import Database
from frontend import Frontend

# Create instances of the necessary classes
colorizer = Colorizer()
database = Database()
frontend = Frontend()

# Train the colorizer on the existing colorized movies
colorizer.train_on_colorized_movies()

# Convert color movies to black and white and add them to the training set
colorizer.add_black_and_white_movies_to_training_set()

# Train the colorizer on the expanded training set
colorizer.train_on_expanded_training_set()

# Retrieve the list of movies from the database
movies = database.get_movies()

# Display the movies on the front-end webpage
frontend.display_movies(movies)
```

    def colorize_movie(self, movie):
        # Code to colorize a black and white movie using the trained model
        # Returns the file path of the colorized movie

Database file: database.py
```python
import sqlite3

    def add_movie(self, movie):
        # Code to add a movie to the database
        
    def get_movies(self):
        # Code to retrieve the list of movies from the database
        # Returns a list of Movie objects
