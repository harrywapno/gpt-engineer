Assuming Python will be used for the backend and front end code, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

Classes:
- Movie: Represents a movie file, with attributes such as title, file path, and colorized status.
- Audio: Represents an audio file, with attributes such as title and file path.
- Subtitle: Represents a subtitle file, with attributes such as title and file path.
- GIF: Represents a GIF file, with attributes such as title and file path.

Functions:
- colorize_movie(movie: Movie) -> None: Takes a Movie object and trains a neural net to colorize the movie file.
- isolate_audio(movie: Movie) -> Audio: Takes a Movie object and isolates the audio file, returning an Audio object.
- create_youtube_channel(audio: Audio) -> str: Takes an Audio object and creates a YouTube channel with the audio file playing on a 24-hour stream, returning the channel URL.
- create_podcast(audio: Audio) -> str: Takes an Audio object and creates a podcast with the audio file, returning the podcast URL.
- generate_subtitles(movie: Movie, srt_file: str) -> Subtitle: Takes a Movie object and an existing .srt file, generates subtitles for the movie, and returns a Subtitle object.
- line_up_subtitles(subtitle: Subtitle, movie: Movie) -> None: Takes a Subtitle object and a Movie object, trains a machine learning program to line up the subtitles to the correct times in the video.
- generate_gifs(movie: Movie) -> None: Takes a Movie object and generates GIFs from the movie file in increments of 42 frames, storing them in a folder with the movie title.
