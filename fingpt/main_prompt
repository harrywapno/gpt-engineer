Create a python file that extracts option chain from NYSE stocks, collect all data that is avaliable for each stock symbol, and the last, ask, bid, volume, implied volitilty. Use addition python script to do black scholes calculations and other numerical calculations on each symbol and option chain. Create an accessible database.
Use the database of information from day 1 and day 2 and so on to create a neural network that trains based on the performance of each option and its predicted value from day to day. Create a predicted price for the option , and measure the error from day to day. Use historical data to train the neural network. Create all files to be run on a single machine and trained
Create additional python program that preprocesses data that will slow down training, use standard methods to deparameterize the data as the data will be too large otherwise.
Use optimization techniques to apply sophisicated trading patterns between pairs of options and stocks, create a neural-net that trains based on option pairs and multiple buy-sell orders that occur on a single day, and multiple days
