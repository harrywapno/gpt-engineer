Based on the given requirements, the following classes, functions, and methods will be necessary:

Classes:
- Stock: Represents a stock symbol and its associated data, including option chains.
- Option: Represents an option contract and its associated data, including last, ask, bid, volume, and implied volatility.
- Database: Represents a database to store stock and option data.
- NeuralNetwork: Represents a neural network for predicting option prices and trading patterns.

Functions:
- extract_option_chain: Extracts option chain data from NYSE stocks.
- calculate_black_scholes: Calculates Black-Scholes values for each option contract.
- preprocess_data: Preprocesses data to reduce its size and complexity.
- train_neural_network: Trains the neural network on historical data.
- optimize_trading_patterns: Applies optimization techniques to trading patterns.

Methods:
- Stock.get_option_chain: Retrieves the option chain for a given stock symbol.
- Database.save_stock_data: Saves stock data to the database.
- Database.save_option_data: Saves option data to the database.
- NeuralNetwork.predict_option_price: Predicts the price of an option contract.
- NeuralNetwork.predict_trading_pattern: Predicts a trading pattern for a given set of option pairs.

The architecture will consist of the following files:

1. main.py - The entry point for the program.
2. stock.py - Contains the Stock and Option classes.
3. database.py - Contains the Database class.
4. neural_network.py - Contains the NeuralNetwork class.
5. data_processing.py - Contains the preprocess_data function.
6. option_chain_extraction.py - Contains the extract_option_chain function.
7. black_scholes.py - Contains the calculate_black_scholes function.
8. training.py - Contains the train_neural_network function.
9. optimization.py - Contains the optimize_trading_patterns function.

The following is the content of each file:

main.py
