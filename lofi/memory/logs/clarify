Generate a youtube channel with an avater that will curate and release the AI generate music weekly.\nThe AI generation should be lightweight and use a midi database of music that exist in the public domain. The novelty of the music, and training of the AI model should be related and changed based on user feedback.\nImplement these programs in python, and other commonly used languages. Create a workspace of files within the IDE.\nAnswer any clarifying questions with intelligent and discrete answers that will produce fully execuatable code with description and readilbility."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Clarification needed:\n1.
