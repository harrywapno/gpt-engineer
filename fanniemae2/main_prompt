Create code that uses machine-learning to do advance data analysis between the different variables and factors of the following data "Del1.csv" and "Del2.csv", provide graphics, a pipeline, and all dependencies that advance data analysis can create with .csv, numpy
variables of the data are "	Current	30-59d DLQ	60-89d DLQ	90-119d DLQ	120-149d DLQ	150-179d DLQ	180d+ DLQ	Prepay	Credit Event	Removal" Difference between files are one borrower or two borrower write program and visualization to show contrast
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
tensorflow
GAN
Use python backend with MVC components
Please implement also the html and js necessary to run the data analysis with only the code you generate
Create executable code that can run with a single python script
compile and fix errors
