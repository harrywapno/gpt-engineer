The ImageProcessor class has two methods: process_image and process_images. The process_image method takes an image file path as input, processes the image, and outputs a plain text file with the same name and location as the original image. The process_images method takes a folder path as input, processes all images in the folder, and outputs plain text files with the same name and location as the original images.\n\nThe main.py file is the entry point for the program and initializes the ImageProcessor class with default parameters. It then calls the process_images method with the folder path as input."}]
