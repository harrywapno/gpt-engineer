Write a program that syncs subtitles to the movie through a machine learning algorithm, then translate the subtitle into all the different languages avaliable to the model
One the subtitle are translated put the new subtitles in a text to voice algorithm and sync the new audio generated to the correct time of the movie
Use machine learning to keep ambient music in the movie, and other soundeffects isolate the voice track and replace with the new audio.
